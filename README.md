# Smart-Contract-for-Composable-Leverage-Protocols

### 📌 Overview
This project involved the design and development of a tailored smart contract to support composable leverage strategies in DeFi. The primary goal was to enable users to interact seamlessly with multiple protocols—Gearbox, Curve, and Sturdy—to execute delta-neutral leveraged yield farming strategies. Targeted at advanced DeFi users and protocol developers, this solution automates capital leveraging, liquidity provision, and debt repayment across multiple chains. It uses flash loans as temporary collateral to unlock complex but optimized yield strategies with minimized risk.

By leveraging Gearbox’s credit system, deploying liquidity on Curve, collateralizing LP tokens on Sturdy, and repaying the flash loan—all within one atomic transaction—the contract provides users with a secure, efficient, and permissionless tool for leveraged yield farming across ecosystems.

### 🎯 Objectives
-Develop a composable smart contract that interacts with multiple DeFi protocols (Gearbox, Curve, and Sturdy) to execute multi-step leveraged strategies.
- Minimize exposure to impermanent loss and maximize capital efficiency using near delta-neutral mechanisms.
- Enable flash loan-based capital deployment without requiring users to front large amounts of collateral.
- Ensure high security, modularity, and ease of extensibility for future DeFi integrations.
- Provide comprehensive documentation for future audits and ease of use.
### What made the project unique?
- Composable Interactions: Seamlessly composed multiple complex DeFi operations into one contract and transaction.
- Flash Loan Mechanism: Used flash loans not just for arbitrage but as temporary collateral to bootstrap leveraged strategies.
- Cross-Protocol Leverage: Enabled borrowing on one protocol and liquidity deployment on another, showcasing true interoperability.
- Delta-Neutral Strategy Execution: Empowered users to maintain a stable exposure with minimized risk.


### 🛠️ My Contributions
- 🔹 Drafted the full Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the composable smart contract including logic flow, expected outcomes, and risk mitigation strategies.
- 🔹 Led the technical design, modularization strategy, and protocol architecture to ensure seamless multi-protocol interactions.
- 🔹 Defined all integration requirements and transaction flows between Gearbox, Curve, and Sturdy.
- 🔹 Oversaw the smart contract development lifecycle, milestone tracking, and coordinated demo handovers.
- 🔹 Ensured robust testing for edge cases and fee-handling logic, especially across flash loan lifecycle stages.
- 🔹 Conducted technical documentation and supported handover for audit-readiness.
- 🔹 Acted as a liaison between the client and dev team, ensuring all objectives were met on time.
